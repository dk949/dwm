List of things I'd like to implement but don't have time for

* [ ] Get status color working
  * Have color appear in the status bar. Will also require a slight rewrite of slstatus
* [X] Look at what changed between 6.2 and 6.5
* [ ] Some cool new patches (more for inspiration than anything else):
  * http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/windowmap/
  * http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscolors/
* [ ] In monocle mode, only draw the top window
* [ ] Use a UTF-8 library instead of hand-rolling
* [ ] Look at `configurenotify`
* [ ] Fix vertical screen cutting off part of status
  * This will likely need something like doing a double high bar ðŸ¤·
* [ ] Check what happens with too many clients on different layouts
* [ ] Make sure `centeredmaster` is `cfact` aware.
* [X] Check if `util` functions are still needed
* [X] Replace all `NULL` with `nullptr`
* [X] Remove `XBACKLIGHT`
* [X] Add notifications
* [ ] Fix exceptions from libnoticeboard
