List of things I'd like to implement but don't have time for
Format: %title%\n    %description%\n    Difficulty: %difficulty%

2. Get status color working
    Have color appear in the status bar. Will also require a slight rewrite of slstatus

3. Layout saving
    Make it possible to apply a specific layout with specific applications in their places (e.g. 2 windows split down the middle, neovim on the left, zathura on the right). Partly implemented in https://github.com/dk949/layout-script
