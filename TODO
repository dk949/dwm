List of things I'd like to implement but don't have time for

1. Get status color working
    Have color appear in the status bar. Will also require a slight rewrite of slstatus

2. Finish implementing workspaces
    When asynchronously spawning applications, they mignt not appear on the screen in the correct order
    Spawn an app -> wait for it to be on the screen -> position on screen
