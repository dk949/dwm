List of things I'd like to implement but don't have time for

* [ ] Get status color working
    * Have color appear in the status bar. Will also require a slight rewrite of slstatus
* [ ] Finish implementing workspaces
    * When asynchronously spawning applications, they mignt not appear on the screen in the correct order
    * Spawn an app -> wait for it to be on the screen -> position on screen
* [ ] Look at what changed between 6.2 and 6.4
* [ ] Some cool new patches (more for inspiration than anything else):
    * http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/windowmap/
    * http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscolors/
