List of things I'd like to implement but don't have time for

* [ ] Get status color working
    * Have color appear in the status bar. Will also require a slight rewrite of slstatus
* [ ] Look at what changed between 6.2 and 6.5
* [ ] Some cool new patches (more for inspiration than anything else):
    * http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/windowmap/
    * http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscolors/
* [ ] In monocle mode, only draw the top window
